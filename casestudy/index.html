        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <p>This project focused on designing and implementing micro interactions that bring clarity and delight to a web form experience. Drawing inspiration from industry-leading practices (such as Apple’s approach to minimal, intuitive interactions) and grounding animations in recognized principles like the 12 principles of animation, the final solution enhanced user engagement and confidence.</p>
            <p>We introduced custom cursors, animated buttons, a slide-in confirmation overlay, and responsive error messaging. These micro interactions not only supported usability goals—reducing form errors and confusion—but also reinforced the brand’s approachable personality. Ultimately, the project achieved smoother user flows and earned positive feedback, making it an effective demonstration of thoughtful interaction design.</p>

        <div class="card__body">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>This solo project was completed over a structured timeline to improve the clarity and usability of a marketing platform’s signup form. Prior iterations lacked immediate feedback, causing users to abandon the process.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Without clear visual and interactive cues, users were often unsure if their input had been registered. Errors went unnoticed, and no immediate confirmation followed successful submissions, resulting in confusion and frustration.</p>

            <h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase form completion rates by providing immediate, intuitive feedback using subtle animations.</li>
                <li>Apply interaction design principles to ensure that micro interactions feel natural and grounded in established design heuristics.</li>
                <li>Incorporate cues inspired by proven examples—from leading brands to peer portfolios—to stand out to potential employers and collaborators.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="card__title">Process & Insight</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
            <p>We began by studying target users—marketing professionals looking for a quick, confident way to submit their information. We examined best-in-class interactions from leading brands, such as Apple’s elegantly minimal hover states, to inspire a clear, uncluttered design language. Reviewing peer portfolios and industry examples helped pinpoint where subtle animations could improve user experience without overwhelming the interface.</p>

            <h3>Ideation & Sketches</h3>
            <p>Initial wireframes placed form fields, call-to-action buttons, and notification areas in a straightforward layout. We refined these sketches iteratively, focusing on how micro interactions would guide the user. Applying the 12 principles of animation—like easing and follow-through—ensured movements felt natural. Incorporating a familiar visual hierarchy ensured that cursor changes, hover effects, and error messages drew immediate attention without feeling jarring.</p>

            <h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3>
            <p>We built low-fidelity prototypes and tested them informally with peers. Early tests revealed a challenge similar to one encountered by other designers: a tooltip near a key interface element was initially clipped by a container. To resolve this, we adjusted the tooltip’s position to display below the element, ensuring it remained fully visible. This iterative process and problem-solving echoed the advice from classmates’ case studies, underscoring the value of refinement and responsiveness to feedback.</p>

            <h3>Design Language</h3>
            <p>We maintained a consistent style—using the Inter typeface, a balanced color palette for clarity, and smooth easing transitions. We ensured accessible typography and proper contrast ratios. Each interaction was tested not only for visual consistency but also for performance, ensuring that animations loaded quickly and did not hinder the user’s overall experience.</p>

            <h2 class="card__title">The Solution</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card__body">
            <h3>Key Micro Interactions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cursor Changes:</strong> A custom cursor dot and outline communicate interactiveness, offering a subtle cue that responds to hover and click events.</li>
                <li><strong>Button Animations:</strong> Buttons lift on hover and depress on click, applying timing and easing principles. A slight delay before navigation provides feedback, reassuring users that their action was registered.</li>
                <li><strong>Slider Transition:</strong> A slide-in overlay confirms successful form submission, inspired by minimal card transitions from recognized brands, giving users a clear next step without abrupt changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Messages:</strong> Fields shake gently and turn red if invalid. This visible, animated cue ensures users cannot miss necessary corrections.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification Pop-ups:</strong> Appearing at the bottom-right corner, these provide timely updates without overwhelming the user, pausing on hover for accessibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Visual & Interaction Details</h3>
            <p>We tied each interaction back to user goals—reducing error rates, improving clarity, and ensuring delight. Drawing from principles championed in other portfolios, including timed hover states and subtle scaling effects, we guaranteed consistency and brand personality. Every decision, from hover timing to tooltip placement, aimed to create a cohesive, intuitive experience.</p>

        <div class="card__body">
            <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
            <p>Post-launch feedback indicated fewer abandoned forms and a smoother user flow. Peers commended the balanced use of animations, calling it both professional and engaging. By applying known animation principles and referencing successful industry examples, we gave the interface a more polished and memorable personality.</p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>As the process was iterative, we learned the importance of testing early and often. Adjusting tooltip positions, refining error states, and continuously revising timings showed how small changes can significantly improve user experience. Like others in our cohort discovered, the first iteration is rarely the best, and embracing refinement is key to better outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Future Steps</h3>
            <p>Moving forward, we plan to explore more advanced animations and delve deeper into interaction design theory. Inspired by positive peer feedback and proven industry techniques, we’ll continue to analyze and iterate on every new interface we build. This project reinforced that well-crafted micro interactions not only guide users but also enrich their overall digital journey.</p>
